# ArduinoSkittleSorter
If you are like me and you don't like orange skittles at all then i have an relatively easy way for you to make sure you will always avoid them from now on:

## Setup
  **You will need:**
  - One Arduino Nano (also works with other types)
  - One Switch Button
  - One Power Jack
  - One Plastic Tube
  - Two Servo Motors


Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcscWI3ANdc) of how it works.
